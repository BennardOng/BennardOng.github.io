							<p> <h3>Will holding a TLSA stock in its early growth stage help me attain my dream car?</h3>
								Lets start by analysing the potential of implementing an algorithm system rather than an investing discretionary approach by weighting up the pros
								and cons. First, lets mention the stock spilts that occurred up to the date from June 29, 2010 to 27 September, 2022.
								<br />
								<br />
								<h4>The stock spilts that occurred since TSLA went public</h4>
								Telsa went public on June 29, 2010 at a price of $17 per share where there was a stock spilt on August 31, 2020 for 5 to 1 and another stock spilt occurred
								on August 25,2022 for a 3 for 1. This will equate to having a total of 15 stocks if the first purchase happened in June 29, 2010.
								<br />
								<br />
								<h4>Total amount if a discretionary approach was used as an investment decision</h4>
								If a discretionary approach was used to make an investment decision and was held until 27 September, 2022, the total amount of the investment from the 1 stock will be
								in total of USD $276.01 multiply by 15 stocks equaling USD $4140.15. <br />
								We make an assumption that the stock was sold at 27 September, 2022 and want to determine what will be the return on investment on the stock.
								<br />
								In percentage terms from a $17 investment and holding it until 27 September, 2022 will equal to a 243 times return which is a 24,300% increase. 
								<br />
								<br />
								<h4>Simple moving average algorithm system implemented on June 29, 2010</h4>
								Lets assume I have the ability to time travel and knew TSLA would reach such heights that I would invest 1 share of TSLA and implement a
								simple moving average algorithm system and let the algorithm system decide on my entry based on technical indicators rather than a discretionary
								decision to understand the business overall objective from gathering information on the director, cash-flow, business objective and financial statements
								of the company.   
								<br />
								<br />
								<h4>Exception based decision</h4>
								Since I made the exception of ignoring my sentiment views of TSLA's future and decided to code an algorithm system based on buy and sell entries
								that is decided by technical analysis. The properties must be verified in the formula on how the diagnostic elements will be considered:
								<br />
								<ul>
									<li>Simple Moving Average 20 </li>
									<li>Simple Moving Average 100</li>
									<li>Buy when </li>
									<li>Sell when </li>
									</ul>
								<h4>Building the backtesting Python program to analyse the above considerations</h4>
								Now we want to find out the difference between whether to invest wholeheartedly believing the stock has great potential or allow an algorithm system
								to make the decision for us.
								<br />
								The first step in our analysis is to know what to import for our analysis and focus on using Python to develop our backtesting idea. <br />
								We will import the following:
								<ul>
									<li>Import yfinance as yf </li>
									<li>Import pandas as pd</li>
									<li>Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt </li>
									</ul>
								<br />
								<h4>Conclusion</h4>
								This analysis showed that a stock in their early growth stages and implementing an algorithm strategy long term was seen unfavourable.<br />
									The summary is to deploy an algorithm system when volatility is high where price had a balanced reasoning in the financial market.
